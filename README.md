Versus Super Mario Bros. 3
==========================

Rules for a two-player competition using 1989's Super Mario Bros. 3 for
the Nintendo Entertainment System.


## Overview

Two plumbers and eight worlds. You've got to save the Princess, but who gets
the glory?

Most levels leave Clear Panels with an "M" or "L" to mark the player who 
defeated it. The player who had a bigger impact on the world map gets credit
for beating the world, and the player who beats the most world wins.

## Scoring

Before a player enters the Castle or engages the Doom Ship (the final level of each
world), the World Points for each player should be tallied based upon how many
Clear Panels sport their plumber's initial:

### Normal Level

![Normal Level][normal_level]

Normal Levels, which leave a Clear Panel with a white background upon completion,
are worth **2 World Points**.

### Special Level

![Special Level][special_level]

Special Levels, including the quicksand and pyramid in World 2, Mushroom Houses, 
and any other level which leave a Clear Panel with a non-white background, are worth
**1 World Point**.

### Blocker Level

![Blocker Level][blocker_level]

Blocker Levels, including Fortresses, Hammer Bros., and any other level
which does not leave a Clear Panel on the world map, are worth **0 World Points**.

### Castle/Doom Ship

![Castle Level][castle_level]

The player who **defeats the Koopaling and grabs the wand** 
(or **defeats Bowser and saves the Princess**) 
earns a **bonus of 2.5 World Points**.

### Victory Points

The player with the **most World Points** at the end of each World earns **1 Victory Point**.
The player who **defeats Bowser** at the end of World 8 gets a **bonus 1/2 Victory Point**
(whether or not she earned the most World Points for World 8).

**The player who earns 4.5 or more Victory Points wins the game.**

### Example

*In the World 1 map above, Mario has earned 7 World Points, and Luigi has won 5 World Points.*
*If Luigi enters the Castle and defeats Larry Koopa, he will have 7.5 World Points, earning*
*him the Victory Point for the first World.*


## Mario Bros. Minigame

An essential part of Versus Super Mario Bros. 3 is the Mario Bros. minigame. In this
game, Mario and Luigi compete head-to-head to collect Coins and dodge Bowser's minions.

![Mario Bros.][mario_bros]

This minigame is initiated when a plumber is standing on the Brother Icon of the other
plumber. *Either player* can press A and draw both players into the minigame.

Typical strategy involves winning the Mario Bros. minigame to force the opponent to lose
their turn, or even to purposely *lose* the minigame and force the opponent to *take* 
their turn (for example, to clear a Blocker Level). Extra Lives can also be won or lost 
by manipulating the Goal Cards lost by a plumber when hit by his opponent or a 
POW Block.

## Game Overs

Game Overs are allowed, and the losing player may Continue. However, remember that
all Clear Panels are reset upon a Game Over, so those World Points are forfiet. Victory 
Points are not lost upon a Game Over, however.


## Rules

The philosophy of Versus SMB3 is to stay as close to the mechanics of the original 
game as possible; however, a few additional rules outside usual gameplay are required to make 
the game fun and fair as a two-player direct competition.

1. No warp whistles are allowed to be used.
2. The Mario Bros. minigame is played at the beginning of every World to determine
   who goes first.
2. The Mario Bros. minigame may not be played twice in a row. The minigame may only 
   be played again after the active player changes through some other means
   (completion of a level or death), or after the completion of a World.


## Variants

Experienced players may wish to add to the base rules to add additional challenge.

### No Extra Lives

Gaining Extra Lives by any means 
(1up Mushrooms, Goal Cards, Coins, etc.) is penalized by awarding the opponent a
Victory Point for each Extra Life gained.

The game no longer ends at 4.5+ Victory Points; the player with the most Victory
Points at the end of World 8 wins the game.

### Limited Items

Whenever the active player holds 4 or more items on the world map, that player
must use items to reduce the total number to 3 or less.
