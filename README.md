Versus Super Mario Bros. 3
==========================

Rules for a two-player competition using 1989's Super Mario Bros. 3 for
the Nintendo Entertainment System.


## Overview

Two plumbers and eight worlds. You've got to save the Princess, but who gets
the glory?

Most levels leave an "M" or "L" to mark the plumber who defeated it. The
player who had a bigger impact on the world map gets credit for beating
the world. The plumber with the most worlds to his name wins the game.
