Versus Super Mario Bros. 3
==========================

Rules for a two-player competition using 1989's Super Mario Bros. 3 for
the Nintendo Entertainment System.


## Overview and Gameplay

Two plumbers and eight worlds. You've got to save the Princess, but who gets
the glory?

Most levels leave Clear Panels with an "M" or "L" to mark the player who 
defeated it. The player who had a bigger impact on the world map gets credit
for beating the world, and the player who beats the most world wins.

## Scoring

Before a player enters the Castle or engages the Doom Ship (the final level of each
world), the World Points for each player should be tallied based upon how many
Clear Panels sport their plumber's initial:

- ![Normal Level](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenClontz/VersusSMB3/master/normal_level.png "Normal Level")
  Normal levels, which leave a Clear Panel with a white background upon completion,
  are worth 2 World Points.
- ![Special Level](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenClontz/VersusSMB3/master/special_level.png "Special Level")
  Special levels, including the quicksand and pyramid in World 2, Mushroom Houses, 
  and any other level which leave an initial with a non-white background, are worth
  1 World Point.
- ![Blocker Level](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenClontz/VersusSMB3/master/special_level.png "Blocker Level")
  Blocker levels, including Fortresses, Hammer Bros., and any other level
  which does not leave an initial on the world map, are worth 0 World Points.

  The player who defeats the Koopaling and grabs the wand (or defeats Bowser and
  saves the Princess) earns a bonus of 2.5 World Points.

The player with the most World Points at the end of each World earns a Victory Point.
The player who defeats Bowser at the end of World 8 gets a bonus 1/2 Victory Point
(whether or not she earned the most World Points for World 8).

The player who earns 4.5 or more Victory Points wins the game.


## Rules

The philosophy of Versus SMB3 is to stay as close to the mechanics of the original 
game as possible; however, a few additional rules are required to make the game
fun and fair as a two-player direct competition.

1. No warp whistles are allowed to be used.
